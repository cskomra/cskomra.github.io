Type a location or type of place in the search box and hit `enter`.

##Basic Functionality
Searches return three basic elements:  1) a list of places, 2) a list of place-types associated with those places, and 3) a map with markers that represent those places.

###Filter Based on Place Type
Click on any place-type value to filter both the Places List and the Markers on the map.  Only places that are of that type will be shown in the list and on the map.

###Locate a Specific Place From the List of Places
Click on any place name in the list to center the map on that place's marker, open it's `infowindow`, and get additional information about it.

###Get Additional Information About a Place
Click on any map marker or place name in the list to view its place name, local address, and get a clickable link to either a Wikipedia article related to that place (if an article is available) or the place's URL from Foursquare (if a Wiki article is not available).

###Start a New Search
Click on the Search radio button to enter a new location (or type of place) in the search box.  Hit `enter` to start a new search.  (Searches are not additive and are based on Powell, OH.)

##Mobile Functionality
On smaller screens, click the menu icon (top right of the screen) to toggle access to Basic Functionality.
